# Python-Practise
This is my first repository in which i am practising python programming and going to make a project.
This is my first commit.
                            Python Programming
                                  Day 1
The current version of Python is 3.13.0,released on October 7, 2024.
fun (). 
a=10;
Name='priya'
b=34.34
c='4545'
contact='+91 8268459680'
print(type(a), type(Name),type(b),type(c))

    ****Without end keyword print change to new line ******
print ("GeeksForGeeks is the best platform for DSA content")
              **** with end keyword ******
# This print() function ends with "**" as set in the end argument.
print ("GeeksForGeeks is the best platform for DSA content", end= "**")
print("Welcome to GFG")

           ****String Concadination********
print("Concatenated Strings")
print('this is' + ' pal')
Name = "priya "
Last_name = "pal"
print(Name + Last_name)

            *****Output formatting ******
            print("output formatting")
a,b=10,23
print("The value of a is {} and b is {}".format(a,b) )

 #          *****Taking Input *****
a = input('Enter the name: ')
print("Entered name is",a)
Pending Topics (Start learning once function by youtube video is done)


#           ******Flush parameter in Python with print() function*****
     Python “sep” parameter in print()
File Argument in Python print()
#******Arathmatic operation ******
print(a+b)
print(a-b)
print(a*b)
print(a/b) to perform division
print(a%b) to find the remainder
Print (a//b) to convert float to integer 

#           ******function ******
Function defination :#parameters are placeholders that represent the values that will be passed to the function when it is called.
Function call :#These arguments are the actual values or expressions that are passed to the function, which will be assigned to the function's parameters when the function executes
This flexibility allows functions to work with different inputs while maintaining a clear structure.

for i in range(5) This will give only 4 number as output. 
Because last number wont be considered to get counter. 


#            ********Module******
 A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. A module can define functions, classes, and variables, and it can also include runnable code. 
  Modules allow you to organize and reuse code in multiple programs.
  Save python code by name.py . In another file we can import this by using import keyword. 
  Syntax: import file_name 
  And i can import import function after importing file by using syntax :
  filename.fun(arguments)
             ******OR*******
by using this syntax:from fileneme import function name

#             *******File handling modes *******
we can open diffirent files by using these functions.
Modes of handling file
#Read, Write,Open
open(),read(),

 #           *******Dictionary********
Stores data as key - value pair 
Help us to keep data in organize structure
we can store values in list type in dictionary to store  it in structute.

 #         ********Diffirence between Error and Exception********
 Diffirence between Error and Exception
If error occures, then program wont execute further.
Occures when some internal events occures  which changes the normal flow of the program, In this case
we can give try and except massage
